## MultiplePotentialActionsVWM

This repository contains the analysis code for the project MultiplePotentialActionsVWM - work in progress. There are two folders **behaviour** and **EEG**, each containing some _subfolders_. The majority of the EEG analysis code is dependent on functions from **Fieldtrip** (https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org). The file _pipeline.txt_ in the main folder provides a description of how to navigate the folders, and in which order to run their scripts.
